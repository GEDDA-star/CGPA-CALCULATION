With this tool, the structure of your XML data is displayed graphically in a tree structure.
The interface presents two panes: one for the structure, and one for the values. 
You may add elements, attributes, comments, and text to the XML document by creating 
the tree structure in the left pane and entering values in the right pane’s
corresponding text boxes.How to Open Notepad in Windows 10
